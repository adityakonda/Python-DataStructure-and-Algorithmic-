## Data Structures

###Binary Tree:  

1. No duplicate. Every node has at most 2 child nodes (Left and Right nodes). 
1. Left Node contain minimum number. 
1.  Right Node contain maximum number 
    
Every iteration we reduce search space by 1/2. 
Suppose we have 8 nodes, to search the least node would be 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1.

>   *   Search complexity = 0(log n)
>   *   Insert complexity = 0(log n)

**Traversal Techniques:**

1.  Breadth first search   

2.  Depth first search 
    1.  In order traversal 
    2.  Pre order traversal 
    3.  Port order traversal
